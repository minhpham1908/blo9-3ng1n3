            <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name
            printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
            mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store.
            And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

            <h3><a href="#phan-1-chuong-1" id="phan-1-chuong-1"></a>Chương 1: Phân tích từ vựng (Lexical Analysis)</h3>
            <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to
            go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that
            bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm
            talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in
            there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?</p>

            <h3><a href="#phan-1-chuong-2" id="phan-1-chuong-2"></a>Chương 2: Phân tích cú pháp (Syntax Analysis)</h3>
            <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
            mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way
            to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
            we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

            <h3><a href="#phan-1-chuong-3" id="phan-1-chuong-3"></a>Chương 3: Phân tích ngữ nghĩa (Semantic Analysis)</h3>
            <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know
            how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times
            they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the
            kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>

            <h2><a href="#phan-2" id="phan-2"></a>Phần 2: Nhóm các giai đoạn</h2>
            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
            darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
            thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And
            you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

            <h3><a href="#phan-2-chuong-1" id="phan-2-chuong-1"></a>Chương 1: Front end</h3>
            <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
            to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
            shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one
            of the ones that became nothing.</p>

            <h3><a href="#phan-2-chuong-2" id="phan-2-chuong-2"></a>Chương 2: Back end</h3>
            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
            know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
            made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
            other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man.</p>
